# Seyaha

This is an Android Application that  provides the tourists who have never been in Jordan before or have a vague knowledge about what to do in Jordan, where to go and how to get the most out of their time in this beautiful country. this app offers a collection of tours both ranked by top rated (peoples favorites) or the user's interests , each tour includes a collection of iconic tourist attraction places.
   
Our plan is to help the tourists to navigate through Jordan without needing the help of a guide or a tourist office that might over charge them or scam them in some way or another.
